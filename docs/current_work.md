# Current Work Status - Phase 5: Testing & Polish

## Optional Enhancements

### W&B Integration (Optional)
- [ ] Add W&B logger integration to CLI commands
- [ ] Configure experiment tracking in training pipeline
- [ ] Add model artifact logging for checkpoints
- [ ] Implement metrics visualization dashboards

## Testing & Validation

### End-to-End Pipeline Testing
- [ ] Test complete training pipeline with synthetic/real data
- [ ] Validate predict command with trained checkpoints
- [ ] Test multi-GPU training with torchrun
- [ ] Verify volume reconstruction accuracy

### Error Handling & Edge Cases
- [ ] Test with various input volume sizes and orientations
- [ ] Validate configuration error handling
- [ ] Test checkpoint loading/resuming functionality
- [ ] Verify CLI argument validation and overrides

## Performance Optimization

### Training Performance
- [ ] Profile training loop for potential bottlenecks
- [ ] Optimize data loading pipeline for faster iteration
- [ ] Test different batch sizes and accumulation strategies
- [ ] Benchmark multi-GPU scaling efficiency
